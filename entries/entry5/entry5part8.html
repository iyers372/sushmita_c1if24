 <h3>Persephone, now a queen not just of the dead but of decay, watched the mortal world crumble, reveling in her power to unmake what once bloomed. She had become the dark queen, ruling over a world of barren fields and endless winter.
    Persephoneâ€™s transformation was complete, corrupted by the very cycle she once embodied. The balance of life and death was forever altered, and from then on, Persephone was feared as the harbinger of desolation.</h3>
