                According to the myth, Zeus, the king of the gods, became enchanted by Europa, a Phoenician princess 
                known for her beauty. Desiring her, Zeus transformed himself into a majestic white bull, as he often 
                used disguises to pursue his interests without alarming his targets. One day, while Europa was 
                gathering flowers by the shore with her maidens, she noticed the magnificent bull grazing nearby. 
                The bull's gentle and calm demeanor intrigued her, and she approached it. As the bull knelt before her, 
                Europa climbed onto its back. At that moment, Zeus sprang up and carried her across the sea to the 
                island of Crete. Once in Crete, Zeus revealed his true identity to Europa. She eventually became the 
                mother of King Minos, the ruler of Crete, and her name was immortalized in mythology. To honor this event, 
                Zeus placed the image of the bull in the stars, creating the Taurus constellation.
