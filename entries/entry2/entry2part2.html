                <h2>The Mad Bull</h2>
                <p>
                    Once in Crete, the bull, no longer under Zeus's control, was driven mad by the power of his transformation. Fueled by rage and power, Taurus went rogue, rampaging through the land and terrorizing the villages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His eyes turned bright red and he had a haunting smile. No longer a symbol of strength, he became a nightmare, slaughtering anyone who came in his way.perate, Europa turned to the goddess Hera for help. Enraged by Zeus's betrayal and the chaos unleashed upon the earth, Hera devised a cruel punishment for both him and the bull. 
                <p>
                    She cursed Taurus to roam the night sky, forever trapped in the constellation that bore his name where he could no longer kill. In the constellation, Taurus was transformed into a grotesque figure, a haunting silhouette against the stars. His once-majestic form became twisted and deformed, reflecting the madness that consumed him.
                </p>

<h2>It’s said that every-time there’s a storm in April and March; it’s the enraged bull trying to escape the sky and come back. </h2>
