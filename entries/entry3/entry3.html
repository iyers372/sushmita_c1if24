            The constellation of Gemini is made up of two twins: Castor and Pollux. Castor was the mortal son of King Tyndareus, 
            while Pollux was the immortal son of Zeus. Both Castor and Pollux, being identical twins, were inseparable in their looks and actions. 
            Castor was a great horseman and Pollux was a great fighter. Together, they went with Jason on the Argo and saved the ship from a terrible storm.
            When Castor was killed in battle, Pollux pleaded with Zeus to bring him back. Zeus agreed to immortalize both Castor and Pollux, 
            if they spent half of their time on the Earth and the other half amongst the stars in the heavens. Since then, when sailors saw these two stars together, 
            they knew their journey would be prosperous. However, seeing only one star foretold bad luck.
