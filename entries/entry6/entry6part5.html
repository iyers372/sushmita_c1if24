            <h3>However, as humanity became more corrupt, Astraea eventually fled to the heavens, where she became associated with the constellation of Libra. Her scales, representing the balance between good and evil, were placed next to her in the sky as the constellation of Libra.
                Thus, Libra's myth revolves around justice, moral balance, and the consequences of human actions. It reflects the <a href="entry6part6.html">eternal pursuit of fairness</a> in an imperfect world.

            <h3>Astraea, horrified by her motherâ€™s descent into <a href="entry6part6.html">tyranny</a>, attempts to restore true justice. However, Themis, now drunk on her power, banishes Astraea to the sky to watch from the stars as she tightens her grip over the earth. The constellation of Libra, once a symbol of fairness, now glows ominously in the night sky, a reminder of Themis's reign of terror, where justice has become a weapon and mercy has no place.
