            <h3>Themis was often depicted holding the <a href="entry6part4.html">scales of justice</a>, which symbolize balance, fairness, and impartiality. Her role was to oversee the laws of both gods and humans, ensuring order and justice in the world. In many stories, Themis advised Zeus, the king of the gods, and helped maintain harmony in both heaven and earth.

            <h3>In this version, Themis, once the goddess of divine law, grows disillusioned with humanityâ€™s endless <a href="entry6part4.html">corruption</a> and disregard for justice. Watching the world descend into chaos, she loses faith in the possibility of fairness. Instead of guiding with wisdom, Themis becomes obsessed with the idea of perfect balance at any cost.No longer believing in the potential for human goodness, she decides to forcibly impose balance, manipulating the scales to favor suffering and destruction to counteract the evils of mankind.</h3>
