            <h3>Themis transforms into a cruel enforcer, weighing people’s souls on her scales—not to judge them fairly, but to determine how much <a href="entry6part5.html">pain and misery</a> they must endure to achieve "balance." For every good deed, an equal amount of suffering is meted out. The world falls into a twisted sense of equilibrium, where no act of kindness goes unpunished and no evil is left unchecked, creating a bleak, dystopian cycle of endless retribution.
