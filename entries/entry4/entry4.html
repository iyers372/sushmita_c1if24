            <h1>LEO THE LION</h1>
            <h2>July 22nd - August 23rd</h2>
            <p>The myth behind the zodiac sign Leo is closely tied to the story of the Nemean Lion from ancient Greek mythology. This lion was a monstrous creature that lived in Nemea and terrorized the surrounding lands. The Nemean Lion had an impenetrable golden fur that no weapon could pierce and claws sharper than any sword.</p>
            <p>The hero Heracles (Hercules in Roman mythology) was tasked with slaying the Nemean Lion as one of his Twelve Labors, a series of seemingly impossible tasks set to him as penance. When Heracles realized that his weapons were useless against the lion's tough hide, he decided to fight the beast with his bare hands. After a fierce struggle, he managed to choke the lion to death.</p>
            <p>Once the lion was slain, Heracles used its own claws to skin it, creating a powerful protective cloak from the impenetrable fur, which he wore as a symbol of his victory. As a reward for Heracles’ accomplishment, the Nemean Lion was placed among the stars by the gods, forming the constellation of Leo.</p>
            <p>Leo is often associated with qualities of bravery, strength, and leadership, reflecting Heracles' courage and the might of the Nemean Lion. The lion itself has long been a symbol of power, dominance, and regal authority.</p>

            <h1>LEO THE MONSTER</h1>
            <h2>July 22nd - August 23rd</h2>
            <p>The Nemean Lion was no mere beast. It was a spawn of chaos, a terror sent by the gods with fur like molten iron, unbreakable by any weapon. The monster stalked the hills of Nemea, its golden eyes glowing in the night, leaving villages in ruin and fear in its wake.</p>
            <p>When Heracles was sent to kill it, he believed his strength could overcome anything. He entered the lion's lair, a cave filled with bones and the stench of decay. Sword and spear shattered against the lion’s hide, as the beast watched with cold amusement.</p>
            <p>In desperation, Heracles threw down his weapons and grappled the creature with his bare hands. But this time, the lion was too strong. Its jaws closed around Heracles’ throat in a flash, and with a brutal snap, the great hero fell silent. The lion's roar shook the heavens, and no mortal would dare challenge it again.</p>
            <p>The gods, in grim recognition of the lion's victory, immortalized it in the stars. The constellation of Leo shines not as a tribute to heroism, but as a warning of the beast that still watches from the heavens, unbeaten and eternal.</p>
            <p>Leo's are known to be reckless, impulsive, and sadistic; just like the Nemean Lion.</p>
