                <h2>The Evil Ram</h2>
                <p>
                    In this dark retelling of the Aries myth, the golden ram was a monstrous creature born from chaos, hungry for mortal flesh. Deceived by its shimmering hide, Phrixus and Helle climbed onto its back, believing it would save them from their doom.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As they soared over the sea, the ram whispered sinister thoughts into Helle’s mind, causing her to lose her grip and fall to her death in the waves below. Realizing too late that Aries was a savage beast, Phrixus clung to it in terror. Upon landing in Colchis, Aries devoured him alive, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.
                <p>
                    The gods, horrified by their creation, trapped Aries in the night sky as a constellation. Not as a symbol of hope, but as a warning—a permanent reminder of the beast that once feasted on the flesh of mortals, ensuring it could never harm anyone again.
                </p>
